Contribution Workflow","content":"This note covers the workflow I use to contribute to open-source projects. I am using `github.com` for simplicity, but basic concepts are the same for all git-based VCS.\n\n## Finding Interesting Projects\nWhen starting your open source contribution journey, the first step is to find a project that interests you. Many sites index good issues for beginners. I am listing down a few sites which I felt comfortable using when getting started.\n- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/index.html)\n- [Up For Grabs (up-for-grabs.net)](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)\n\n## Forking Repository\nOnce, you have figured out which project you want to contribute to, you can create a fork. A fork in github is an exact copy of some existing repository but under your username or org. You have full access to the forked repository, consider it your copy of code. You are going to add stuff here.\n![[Excalidraw/github/fork.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Developing in Forked Repository\nBefore you can start contributing to any project, you need to first clone the forked repository in your development machine. Cloning will bring a copy of your forked repository to your local system. Once you have cloned the forked repository, you can start doing changes.  In the figure below, we start by creating `file1` in step 3 and committing them to the local branch `feature-branch`. After committing targeted changes in the local branch, you can push this local branch to a remote forked repository. After reviewing code changes, you can either merge these changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request against the `upstream` source project. The following figure shows the workflow used to do changes in a forked repo.\n![[Excalidraw/github/develop-in-fork.excalidraw.png]]\n\n### Staging changes\nAny file changes(including creation \u0026 deletion) stay in the working area by default. Git also provides us with a preparation area called staging. Whatever is present in staging gets saved permanently to `.git` when we commit. The following figure shows how the file changes move when using git commands.\n![[Excalidraw/github/staging-process.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Pull Requests\nPull requests are not part of git, but rather part of git-based websites. Pull requests provide easy to use interface to review changes done by contributors and approve, request changes or merge them in your repo. A pull request has 2 parts to it, `base(target)` refers to the place where you want to contribute, and `compare(source)` refers to the place from where the changes should be picked for contribution. Both `base` and `compare` can refer to different repo and branch. The following figure shows how pull requests help maintainers merge changes to their repositories.\n![[Excalidraw/github/pull-request.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Sync Fork Repository\nUsually, any open source project has a very high commit frequency, as there are so many contributors who keep on adding stuff on the go. This also means, your fork is going to go out-of-sync/outdated very frequently. Thus, we need to keep `main` from our fork repository in sync with `main` from the source project. This can be done using the concept of upstream. Your local git repository has a table of remote URLs, this can be viewed using `git remote -v`. You can configure your local repository to have an `upstream` remote URL referring to the source project repo. You always pull changes from `upstream: main` and push them to `origin: main`.\n![[Excalidraw/github/sync-fork.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Important Tips\n- Avoid changes to `main` branches, if you commit something in main and it diverges from `upstream: main`, it will become very difficult to reconcile changes\n- Always create a new branch from `main` when working on a new feature\n- A fork can be created under any `user` or `org`, you can have a fork under org to share across the team\n- As long as your `.git` folder is intact, you can recover any changes you lose from the working directory\n- Pull requests are not essential, but help the maintainer when reviewing changes\n\n## Conclusion\nThis note only covers the bare minimum required to start contributing to git projects. Additional reading is recommended to understand git fundamentals.\n\n## Cheatsheet\n[Free Git Book (goalkicker.com)](https://books.goalkicker.com/GitBook/)","lastmodified":"2022-05-26T17:26:44.035392098Z","tags":null},"/random/algorithms":{"title":"Introduction to Algorithms","content":"\nInformally, an **algorithm** is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.\n\nWe can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**. The statement of the problem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship. The algorithm describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.\n\nAlgorithms is a very broad topic and cannot be covered in individual note, I would recommend using **#algorithm** tag to find all notes related to algorithms.

You visit the website and try creating new account, but get a message, `Username is already taken`. You add some random numbers at end, but you still get same error message. This process is frustating, until you find a username that works.\n\nEver wondered, how they check availability of usernames so fast? when they have millions of registered users.\n\nThere are multiple ways to solve this problem -\n1. **Linear search** - go through database and compare every username with the username you entered to find if it exists. This will probably take years before you can create a new account.\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/waiting.jpg]]\n\n2. **Binary Search** - store usernames alphabetically and try finding the entered username using binary search. This is better than previous approach, but still requires many steps when you have millions of users.\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/binary_search.png]]\n\n3. **Trie** - store usernames in a trie and try finding the entered username. This have way better performance than previous 2 approaches, but it requires more memory to store millions of users. Also the overhead of maintaining trie is huge for so many users.\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/trie.png]]\n\n**Bloom filter** can solve this problem. You need to understand hashing to learn how bloom filter works. A hash function maps some input to a fixed length unique identifier output, this output can be used for identifying input.\n\n## What is it?\nA Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test if an element is a member of a set. The tradeoff for efficiency is the probabilistic nature of bloom filter, which means there might be some false positives. False positive means, bloom filter may say that a username is already used, even when it's not.\n\n## Properties\n- Bloom filter with fixed size can represent a set with very large number of elements\n- Adding element never fails, but false positives increase as more elements are added\n- Never generates false negatives\n- Deleting elements from filter isn't possible\n\n## How it works?\nAn empty bloom filter is a **bit array** of **n**  bits, all set to zero. We also need **k** hash functions to calculate hash function for a given input. For adding an element to bloom filter we set **k** indices calculated using hash function h\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e(x), h\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e(x), ..., h\u003csub\u003ek\u003c/sub\u003e(x) to 1.\n\nExample - If we have a bloom filter with 10 bits and 3 hash functions h\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e, h\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e, h\u003csub\u003e3\u003c/sub\u003e. Initial value for all bits in bloom filter will be 0. \n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/empty_bloom_filter.excalidraw.png]]\n\nWe then calculate hash for the word to be added and set the indices returned by hash function to 1.\n```java\n// word to be added - shubham\nh1(\"shubham\") % 10 = 2\nh2(\"shubham\") % 10 = 6\nh3(\"shubham\") % 10 = 9\n```\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/bf1.excalidraw.png]]\n\n```java\n// word to be added - alex\nh1(\"alex\") % 10 = 1\nh2(\"alex\") % 10 = 6\nh3(\"alex\") % 10 = 10\n```\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/bf2.excalidraw.png]]\n\nTo check if a element is present in bloom filter, we do the same process in reverse. You get back indexes using hash functions \u0026 check indexes. If all indexes are set to 1 the word is **probably present**, but if any of these indexes is 0, the word is **definitely not present**.\n\n## False Positives\n\nThere is a possiblity of 2 words returning same values from hash function. This means we can get false positives where a word wasn't added to bloom filter.\n\nAssume a word that was not added to bloom filter, but returns hash values which are already set.\n\n```java\n// word to be checked - bob\nh1(\"bob\") % 10 = 2\nh2(\"bob\") % 10 = 6\nh3(\"bob\") % 10 = 9\n```\n\n![[Excalidraw/bloom_filter/bf3.excalidraw.png]]\n\nHere we never added **bob** to the bloom filter, but it is still present in filter. This means we can be **100%** sure if something isn't available in filter, but not the other way around.\n\nWe can control the probability of getting false positives by controlling the size of bloom filter. More bits means fewer false positives. We can also increase the number of hash functions to check more bits and reduce false positives. This also increases latency to add and check elements in bloom filter.\n\nLet **n** be the size of bit array, **k** be the number of hash functions and **n** be the number of elements to be inserted in the filter, then probability of false positives **p** can be calculated as follows:\n\n$\\mathrm{P} = \\left( 1-\\left[ 1-\\frac{1}{n} \\right]^{km} \\right)^{k}$\n\nIf **m** is max number elements expected to be handled by bloom filter and desired false positive probability is **p**, the the size of bit array **n** can be calcuated as follows:\n\n$\\mathrm{n} = -\\frac{mln{P}}{(ln{2})^{2}}$\n\nIf **n** is size of bit array and **m** is number of elements to be inserted then optimum number if hash functions **k** can be calculated as follows:\n\n$\\mathrm{k} = \\frac{n}{m}ln{2}$\n\nBloom filter are very space efficient, as data items are not stored. Using bit array allows hash collision, without hash collision, it would not be compact.\n\n## Supported Operations\n- **insert(x)** - insert an element to bloom filter\n- **lookup(x)** - check whether an element is already present in bloom filter with a probability of false positive\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nNote: Elements cannot be deleted from bloom filter.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n## Choosing Hash Function\nAll hash functions used in bloom filter should be independent from each other and uniformly distributed. These hash functions should be fast. Getting hash is most frequently used operation in bloom filters. Cryptographic hash functions provide stability but are expensive to calculate. Increasing hash functions slows bloom filter. Non-cryptographic hash functions do not provide guarantee but do provide major performance improvements.\n\nFast simple non cryptographic hashes which are independent of each other include [MurmurHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash), [Fowler‚ÄìNoll‚ÄìVo hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function), [Jenkins hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function).\n\n## Applications\nBloom filters should be used when:\n- Data to be searched is large\n- Memory available on the system is limited/low\n\nSome real world usage:\n- Detect weak passwords\n- Google Chrome Safe Browsing(URL bloom filter)\n- Antivirus(Content bloom filter)\n\n## Conclusion\nThis note covers basics of bloom filter and when to use them. I recommend reading more about non-cryptographic hash functions and how to use them.","lastmodified":"2022-05-26T17:26:44.039392109Z","tags":null},"/random/java_11_collections":{"title":"Java 11 Fundamentals: Collections","content":"\nEvery application requires wide variety of data structures based on your use case. Implementing every basic data structures yourself is error prone, it's hard to get everything right. This is one of the reasons why java provides [collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html) with jdk. \n\n## The Array Problem\nSome may argue why not use array everywhere? \nYes, you can but is it worth it? \n\nGiven below are some problems associated with array: \n- Increasing size - Adding new elements in already filled array requires creating new array and copying values from old one. Old array is left for garbage collection, resulting in memory wastage.\n- Homogeneous object storage - You can only store objects of same type in an array.\n- Deletion \u0026 Insertion - You cannot easily insert or delete elements at middle of the array.\n\nApart from the issues above, the complexity is also very bad for frequently used operations in array.\n\n|        Array Operation         | Real Time Complexity | Assumed Time Complexity |\n|:------------------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n|      Access i-th element       |    O($\\sqrt{N}$)     |          O(1)           |\n|     Traverse all elements      |  O(N + $\\sqrt{N}$)   |          O(N)           |\n| Override element at i-th index |    O($\\sqrt{N}$)     |          O(1)           |\n|        Insert element E        |  O(N + $\\sqrt{N}$)   |          O(N)           |\n|        Delete element E        |  O(N + $\\sqrt{N}$)   |          O(N)           |\n\n## Collection Design\n![[Excalidraw/collections/collections.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Choosing Collection\n![[Excalidraw/collections/which_collection.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Collection Behaviors\nCollection interface extends iterable interface which allows creating iterator object. Iterator objects can be used to loop over collections. \n\n![[Excalidraw/collections/iterable.excalidraw.png]]\n\nSample code snippet showing iterator usage provided below:\n\n```java\n// Make a collection\nList\u003cString\u003e movies = new ArrayList\u003cString\u003e();\nmovies.add(\"Matrix\");\nmovies.add(\"Spiderman\");\nmovies.add(\"Batman\");\n\n// Get iterator\nIterator\u003cString\u003e it = movies.iterator();\n\n// Looping through collection\nwhile(it.hasNext()) {\n\t// process collection elements\n\tSystem.out.println(it.next());\n}\n\n```\n\n## Lists\nLists are collection of elements having defined iteration order where each element has an index.\n\n### ArrayList\n\nArraylist uses dynamic array for storing objects. It is good for general purpose implementation and can be used as default implementation in most cases. Arraylist is also CPU cache sympathetic because of the way it is stored in-memory. Initial ArrayList starts with default capacity and creates a new array with double the current capacity once it is full while copies elements from old array. ArrayList grows using doubling strategy as shown in figure below.\n\n![[Excalidraw/collections/arraylist_doubling.excalidraw.png]]\n\n### LinkedList\n\nLinkedList has same implementation as doubly linked list and uses pointers to traverse across the data structure. Use linkedlist when there are very frequent addition/removal of elements at start. For most cases linkedlists will have worse performance than arraylist.\n\n![[Excalidraw/collections/doubly-linked-list.excalidraw.png]]\n\n### Performance Comparison\n\n|            | get  |    add     | contains | next | remove |\n|:----------:|:----:|:----------:|:--------:|:----:|:------:|\n| ArrayList  | O(1) | O(N), Œ©(1) |   O(N)   | O(1) |  O(N)  |\n| LinkedList | O(N) |    O(1)    |   O(N)   | O(1) |  O(N)  |\n\n## Maps\nMaps are collections of pairs, they have keys and values. Dictionary is a good example of map, where you find meaning of word by using word as key. In java maps, keys are unique, and the uniqueness is defined by keys equals/hashcode method. Use maps over other data structures when doing frequent lookups.\n\n### HashMap\n\nHashMap is a good general purpose implementation for most usecases. Hashmap uses a `.hashcode()` function to generate hash values for a key. The generated hashcodes are stored in an array of buckets. Buckets are linked lists to accomodate for hash collisions. Elements are stored in `hash % bucket_count` bucket.  Buckets can also be trees in some cases. Number of buckets can increase with more elements and a rehash of all keys happens during this expansion of hashmaps.\n\n![[Excalidraw/collections/hashmap.excalidraw.png]]\n\n### TreeMap\n\nTreeMap defines sort order and adds functionality. You can look at subsections of map based on sort order. This can perform better for some specific usecases. Underlying implementation of TreeMap is a red/black tree(a balanced binary tree). Elements with lower value are stored on left branch of these trees \u0026 higher values are stored in right branch. The tree gets re-balanced, so it never goes longer than **$\\log_{2}N$** in terms of depth, where N is the number of elements. In general treemaps are slower than hashmaps, because of too many pointer operations, but treemap provides the navigation and sorting functionality which is missing in hashmaps.\n\nFollowing example shows world population stored in treemap, it is easy to find cities with population in specific range, max population city, min population city, etc.\n\n![[Excalidraw/collections/treemap.excalidraw.png]]\n\nJDK also has other implementations of Map as well like EnumMap, LinkedHashMap \u0026 IdentityHashMap. Read official docs to know more in-depth.\n\n### Performance Comparison\n|         |    put     |    get     | containsKey |     next      |\n|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|\n| HashMap | O(N), Œ©(1) | O(N), Œ©(1) | O(N), Œ©(1)  | O(Capacity/N) |\n| TreeMap | O(log(N))  | O(log(N))  |  O(log(N))  |   O(log(N))   |\n\n## Sets\n\nSets are collections with uniqueness as fundamental property. When `equals` method on two objects return same value, they are considered equal. Sets have no two objects within them with same equals value. Implementation of `equals` may require implementing `hashcode` or `comparator`.\n\n### HashCode / Equals Contract\n\nMany APIs within JDK have contracts between them.  Contracts are assumptions being made by any class within JDK and there are obligations on your code that you need to meet in order for that class functionality to work.\n\nSince HashMap/HashSet depend on `hashCode` to find slots in bucket and `equals` to compare if two values is equal. If a developer doesn't properly define this functions there is a possibility of you getting in a situation with duplicate objects within set or same object present in different buckets in hashmap. If there are 2 objects `object1` and `object2`, the hashcode/equals contract is as follows:\n\n`object1.equals(object2)` $\\implies$ `object1.hashCode() == object2.hashCode()`\n\nThis is one way implication, 2 different object can have same hashCode, but same objects should always have same hashCode. Violating this contract will break the functionality of your class.\n\nThis contract is important because java has 2 types of equality - reference based and value based. Reference based just needs to inherit equals from Object. Value based requires a custom equals method. For value based equality proper equals \u0026 hashcode implementation should be defined.\n\nJava 8+ have `hashCode()` for almost all primitives. Modern IDEs can auto-generate hashCode imeplementation for you. Java 7+ also has `Objects.hash()` that generates hashcode by combining individuals fields inside an object, but this function has high performance overhead, so, avoid using it.\n\n```java\n// Arrays\nArrays.hashCode();\n\n// Primitives (Java 8+)\nLong.hashCode(longValue);\n\n// Old Primitives (\u003c Java 8)\n(int) (l ^ (l \u003e\u003e\u003e 32)) // long l\nFloat.floatToIntBits(f); // float f\n```\n\n### HashSet\n\nHashSet is based upon HashMap and uses the HashMap implementation. HashSet is a HashMap with bucket size of 1. HashSet is good for general purpose and should be used by default.\n\n### TreeSet\n\nTreeSet is based upon TreeMap and uses the TreeMap implementation(red/black binary tree), it provides features for searching and navigation within set. TreeSet is TreeMap without any duplicate nodes in tree.\n\n## Streams\n\n[Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) are powerful new abstractions introduced in Java 8. Stream class provides functional-style operations on stream of elements, such as map-reduce transformations on collections. I would recommend using streams to do any kind of transformation in collections instead of traditional loops. Using stream improves readability and reduces boilerplate code.\n\nExample code snippet to show stream usage:\n\n```java\n// find sum of weights of red widgets\nint sum = widgets.stream()\n\t.filter(b -\u003e b.getColor() == RED)\n\t.mapToInt(b -\u003e b.getWeight())\n\t.sum();\n```\n\nStreams are usually used with collectors. I would recommend reading [Collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collectors.html) documentation for examples.\n\nExample code snippet to show collector usage:\n\n```java\n// Accumulate names into a List\nList\u003cString\u003e list = people.stream()\n\t.map(Person::getName)\n\t.collect(Collectors.toList());\n```\n\n## Factory Methods\n[Collections](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html) class provides many utility methods which can help prevent redundant implementation of commonly used functionality like, find min \u0026 max from list, create empty set, etc. Most factory methods are optimized for performance, as they have generic implementation details.\n\nHaving empty collections can be useful when you want to pass an empty collection as argument, or you want to return an empty collection from a function.\n\n```java\n// Empty Collections\nList\u003cString\u003e list = Collections.emptyList();\nMap\u003cInteger, String\u003e map = Collections.emptyMap();\nSet\u003cInteger\u003e set = Collections.emptySet();\n```\n\nSingletons are helpful when you want to create collections with single value.\n\n```java\n// Singletons\nList\u003cString\u003e list = Collections.singletonList(\"one\");\nMao\u003cInteger, String\u003e map = Collections.singletonMap(1, \"one\");\nSet\u003cInteger\u003e set = Collections.singleton(1);\n```\n\nCollection factories allow creating collections without a lot of boilerplate code.\n\n```java\nList\u003cString\u003e list = List.of(\"India\", \"USA\");\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e map = Map.of(\"Shubham\", 1000, \"Alex\", 5000);\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e entries = Map.ofEntries(\n\tMap.entry(\"Shubham\", 1000),\n\tMap.entry(\"Alex\", 5000)\n);\n```\n\nJava 10 introduced immutable copies approach as an alternative to immutable factory methods.\n\n```java\n// Modifying names does not modify immutableNames\nCollection\u003cString\u003e names = new ArrayList();\nnames.add(\"Shubham\");\nnames.add(\"Alex\");\n\n// add/remove/updated prohibited\nList\u003cString\u003e immutableNames = List.copyOf(names);\n\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e budget = new HashMap\u003c\u003e();\nbudget.put(\"Shubham\", 1000);\nbudget.put(\"Alex\", 5000);\n\n// add/remove/updated prohibited\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e immutableBudget = Map.copyOf(budget);\n```\n\nJava 9 introduced unmodifiable views.\n\n```java\n// Modifying names is the only way to modify namesView\nList\u003cString\u003e names = new ArrayList\u003c\u003e();\nnames.add(\"Shubham\");\nnames.add(\"Alex\");\n\n// add/remove/updated prohibited directly, still possible through names\nList\u003cString\u003e namesView = Collections.unmodifiableList(names);\n\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e budget = new HashMap\u003c\u003e();\nbudget.put(\"Shubham\", 1000);\nbudget.put(\"Alex\", 5000);\n\n// add/remove/updated prohibited, still possible through budget\nMap\u003cString, Integer\u003e budgetView = Collections.unmodifiableMap(budget);\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nThis article should help you choose correct collection for your usecase and identify tradeoff between different collections.

In OAuth, every client is issued different set of credentials than those of the resource owner. Instead of using the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources, the client obtains an access token -- a string denoting a specific scope, lifetime, and other access attributes. Access tokens are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\n\n### Roles\nOAuth defines four roles:\n1. **Resource owner** - An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user. Example - Google account owner/end user\n2. **Resource server** - The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. Example - [People API](https://developers.google.com/people/)\n3. **Client** - An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. The term \"client\" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., wheather the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices). Example - Twitter web/android app\n4. **Authorization Server** - The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. Example - [Google Identity Service](https://developers.google.com/identity)\n\nReal world example showing all roles - When you press login with google button in twitter(**Client**) login page, it redirects you to google(**Authorization Server**) login page. After logging into google, it requests your(**Resource Owner**) permission to allow access to your contacts from People API(**Resource Server**). Twitter uses this contact info to suggest people to follow.\n\n### Protocol Flow\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/abstract-protocol-flow.excalidraw.png]]\n\nThe figure above illustrates abstract OAuth 2.0 flow with interaction between the 4 roles and includes following steps:\n\n\u003col type=\"A\"\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eClient request authorization from request owner\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eClient receives authorization grant, which is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eClient requests an access token by authenticating with authorization server and presenting authorization grant\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAuthorization server authenticates client and validates authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eClient requests protected resource from resource server presenting access token\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eResource server validates access token, and if valid, server the request\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n### Authorization Grant\nAuthorization grant is a credential representing resource owner's authorization used by the client to obtain an access token.\n\nThere are 4 types of authorization grant:\n1. Authorization Code Grant\n2. Implicit Grant\n3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant\n4. Client Credentials Grant\n\n[RFC 6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) also provides extensibility mechanism for defining additional types.\n\n### Access Token\nAccess tokens are credentials used to access protected resources. An access token is a string representing an authorization issues to the client. The string is usually opaque to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by resource owner, and enforced by resource server and authorization server.\n\n### Refresh Token\nRefresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens. Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the auhorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when current access token becomes invalid ot expires, or to obtain additional access token with narrower scope (access tokens may have shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by resource owner).\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nRefresh tokens are intended for use only with authorization server and are never sent to resource servers.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nFollowing figure illustrates how refresh tokens are used to get new access token.\n\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/refresh-expired-access-token.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Client Registration\nBefore initiating the protocol, client registers itself with authorization server. This process is beyond the scope of this note but typically involves end-user interaction with an HTML registration form. \n\nExample - Google Login Page after getting redirected by a website\n\nWhen registering a client, the client developer shall:\n- specify the client type\n- provide its client redirection URIs\n- include any other information required by the authorization server (e.g., application name, website, description, logo image, the acceptance of legal terms)\n\n### Client Types\nOAuth defines 2 client types, based on their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials):\n\n- **confidential** : Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means. \n- **public** : Client incapable of maintaining the confidentiality if their credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the resource owner, such as an installed native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable of secure client authentication via any other means.\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nAuthorization server SHOULD NOT make assumptions about the client type.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nClient type specification mentioned above was designed around the following client profiles:\n- **Web application** : A web application is a confidential client running on a web server. Resource owners access the client via an HTML user interface rendered in a user-agent on the device used by the resource owner. The client credentials as well as any access token issued to client are stored on the web server and are not exposed to or accessible by resource owner.\n- **User-agent-based application** : A user-agent-based application is a public client in which the client code is downloaded from a web server and executes within a user-agent(e.g., web browser) on the device used by the resource owner. Protocol data and credentials are easily accessible (and often visible) to resource owner. Since such applications reside within the user-agent, they can make seamless use of the user-agent capabilities when requesting authorization.\n- **Native application** : A native application is a public client installed and executed on the device used by the resource owner. Protocol data and credentials are accessible to the resource owner. It is assumed that any client authentication credentials included in the application can be extracted. On the other hand, dynamically issued credentials such as access tokens or refresh tokens can receive acceptable level of protection. At a minimum, these credentials are protected from hostile servers with which the application may interact. On some platforms, these credentials might be protected from other applications residing on the same device.\n\n### Client Identifier\nAuthorization server issues a unique client identifier to every registered client. Client identifier is not a secret and is exposed to resource owner.\n\n### Client Authentication\nFor confidential client type, client and authorization server establish client authentication method suitable for the security requirement of the authorization server.\n\nConfidential clients are typically issues a set of client credentials used for authenticating with the authorization server (e.g., password, public/private key pair). **Example** - Applications in Cloud Foundry may use client credentials present in **VCAP_SERVICES** for any oauth secured service.\n\n## Protocol Endpoints\nThe authorization process utilizes 2 authorization server endpoints (HTTP resources):\n- **Authorization Endpoint** - used by the client to obtain authorization from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.\n- **Token Endpoint** - used by the client to exchange an authorization grant for an access token, typically with client authentication.\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nNot every authorization grant type utilizes both endpoints.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\nAs well as one client endpoint:\n- **Redirection endpoint** - used by the authorization server to return responses containing authorization credentials to the client via the resource owner user-agent.\n\n## Obtaining Authorization\nTo request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner. The authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant, which client uses to request access token.\n\n### Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.\nSince this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server. \n\nThe Authorization Code grant can be used anytime you connect a user¬†profile to one or multiple accounts from within a website¬†and for instance you authorize¬†the website to access information owned from LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc‚Ä¶.even all at the same time.\n\nExample - Connecting linkedin account to twitter account and allowing linkedin to access your twitter timeline information.\n\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/authorization-code-flow.excalidraw.png]]\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nThe lines illustrating steps A, B, C are broken into two parts as they pass through the user-agent.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n\n### Implicit Grant\n\nThe implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens(without any support for refresh token) and is optimized for public clients known to operate a particular redirection URI. These clients are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as Javascript.\n\nSince this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.\n\nUnlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes separate requests for authorization and for an access token, the client receives the access token as the result of the authorization request.\n\nThe implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of the redirection URI.  \n\nThe Implicit Grant is very similar to the Authorization grant , but is not as secure as the first one. Another application running on the same machine / device could steal the authorization information exchanged between the client and the third party library and use it.\n\nA malicious client can impersonate another client and obtain access to protected resources, if the impersonated client fails to, or is unable to, keep its client credentials confidential.

Real examples include android web apps \u0026 some websites redirecting you to another website in new tab. The control moves from your application to another website in  new tab, thus making it very risky.\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nThe access token is encoded into the redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other applications residing on the same device.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/implicit-grant-flow.excalidraw.png]]\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nThe lines illustrating steps A and B are broken into two parts as they pass through the user-agent.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n### Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant\n\nThe resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged application.\n\nThis grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using an interactive form).  It is also used to migrate existing clients using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an access token.\n\nExample - Standalone applications in your device like netflix app in andorid phone.\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\n The authorization server should take special care when enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not viable.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/resource-owner-password-credentials-flow.excalidraw.png]]\n\n### Client Credentials Grant\n\n The client can request an access token using only its client credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization server).\n\nExample - Application Hosted in Cloud Foundry authenticating to get access to backing service.\n\n\u003cspan style=\"color: red;\"\u003e\nThis flow doesn't involve any end-user and should only be used for machine-to-machine authentication in order to allow some server side code to access some protected resource like third-party Web API.\n\u003c/span\u003e\n\n![[Excalidraw/oauth/client-credentials-flow.excalidraw.png]]\n\n## Conclusion\nI didn't cover authorization request/response, access token request/response formats and security considerations here. Please refer RFC for getting detailed request/response formats. The OAuth 2.0 Core Framework (RFC 6749) only defines roles and a base level of functionality. Implementation details are left unspecified as out of scope for RFC. OAuth Working Group has published additional RFCs built on top of core framework to fill missing gaps. I would try covering some of those RFCs in future notes. \n\nThis note only covers essential content from [RFC 6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html).\n","lastmodified":"2022-05-26T17:26:44.039392109Z","tags":null},"/system_design/back_envelope_estimation":{"title":"Back of the Envelope Estimation","content":"\nCreating design for a system isn't helpful unless you can justify why your design is better than others. After creating a design, there will be questions on weather the design fulfills the specified requirements. \n\nAccording to **Jeff Dean**, Google Senior Fellow, **\"**back-of-the-envelope calculations are estimates you create using a combination of thought experiments and common performance numbers to get a good feel for which design will meet your requirements.**\"**\n\nA good sense of scalability basics are required to do back-of-the-envelope estimation.\n\n## Power of two\nAn **ASCII** character uses one byte of memory (8 bits).

But, these numbers should still help you to get general idea of fastness and slowness of different computer operations.\n\n|               Operation name                |          Time           |\n|:-------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------:|\n|             L1 cache reference              |         0.5 ns          |\n|              Branch mispredict              |          5 ns           |\n|             L2 cache reference              |          7 ns           |\n|              Mutex lock/unlock              |         100 ns          |\n|            Main memory reference            |         100 ns          |\n|        Compress 1K bytes with Zippy         |    10,000 ns = 10 Œºs    | \n|      Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network      |    20,000 ns = 20 Œºs    |\n|     Read 1 MB sequentially from memory      |   250,000 ns = 250 Œºs   |\n|    Round trip within the same datacenter    |   500,000 ns = 500 Œºs   |\n|                  Disk seek                  |  10,000,000 ns = 10 ms  |\n|   Read 1 MB sequentially from the network   |  10,000,000 ns = 10 ms  |\n|      Read 1 MB sequentially from disk       |  30,000,000 ns = 30 ms  |\n| Send packet CA(California)-\u003eNetherlands-\u003eCA | 150,000,000 ns = 150 ms |\n\n**ns = nanosecond\nŒºs = microsecond\nms = millisecond**\n\n**1 ns = 10\u003csup\u003e-9\u003c/sup\u003e seconds\n1 Œºs = 10\u003csup\u003e-6\u003c/sup\u003e seconds = 1,000 ns\n1 ms = 10\u003csup\u003e-3\u003c/sup\u003e seconds = 1,000 Œºs = 1,000,000 ns**\n\nSome conclusions from above numbers-\n- Memory is fast but disk is slow\n- Avoid disk seeks if possible\n- Simple compression algorithms are fast\n- Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible\n- Data centers are usually in different regions, and it takes time to send data between them\n\n## Availability numbers\nA **service level agreement(SLA)** is commonly used as an agreement between the service provider and their customer. This agreement formally defines the level of uptime your service will deliver. The uptime is measured as percentage and it falls between **99%** and **100%** for most services. Uptime is typically measured in nines, more nines is better. Number of nines correlate to the expected system downtime.\n\n| Availability % |  Downtime per day   | Downtime per year |\n|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|\n|      99%       |    14.40 minutes    |     3.65 days     |\n|     99.9%      |    1.44 minutes     |    8.77 hours     |\n|     99.99%     |    8.64 seconds     |   52.60 minutes   |\n|    99.999%     | 864.00 milliseconds |   5.26 minutes    |\n|    99.9999%    | 86.40 milliseconds  |   31.56 seconds   |\n\nAnything above 5 nines is considered highly available.\n\n## Example: Estimate Twitter QPS and storage requirements\nFollowing numbers are just to showcase how back-of-the-envelope-estimation works, these are not real numbers from twitter.\n\n### Assumptions\n- 300 million monthly active users\n- 50% of users use twitter daily\n- Users post 2 tweets per day on average\n- 10% of tweets contain media\n- Data is stored for 5 years\n\n### Estimations\n**Query per second(QPS)** estimate:\n- Daily active users(DAU) = 300 million \\* 50% = 150 million\n- Tweets QPS = 150 million \\* 2 tweets / 24 hour / 3600 seconds = ~3500\n- Peek QPS = 2 \\* QPS = ~7000\n\nWe will only estimate media storage here.\n- Average tweet size:\n\t- tweet_id -\u003e 64 bytes\n\t- text -\u003e 140 bytes\n\t- media -\u003e 1 MB\n- Media storage: 150 million \\* 2 \\* 10% \\* 1 MB = 30 TB per day\n- 5-year media storage: 3 TB \\* 365 \\* 5 = ~55 PB\n\n\n## Tips\nBack-of-the-envelope estiimations don't need to be extremely accurate, they are just meant to give approximate idea of scale. Few tips are as follows-\n- Rounding and Approximation wherever necessary for speed calculation, precision isn't expected at design stage\n- Write down assumptions to be referenced later\n- Label units to remove ambiguity from numbers and not confuse yourself\n\n## Conclusion\nThis note gives basic idea of how back-of-the-envelope calculations work. You should practice these calculations on all designs you visit. More practice will help you get rough numbers in mind and select or discard ideas when brainstorming new system design.\n\n## References\n- [[books/sys_design_alex_xu]]","lastmodified":"2022-05-26T17:26:44.039392109Z","tags":null}}
